    "question": "What are Tick Bars, Volume and Dollar Bars?",
    "answer": "The idea behind tick bars is straightforward: The sample variables\nlisted earlier (timestamp, VWAP, open price, etc.) will be extracted each time a predefined number of transactions takes place, e.g., 1,000 ticks. Volume bars sample\nevery time a pre-defined amount of the security\u2019s units (shares, futures contracts,\netc.) have been exchanged. For example, we could sample prices every time a\nfutures contract exchanges 1,000 units, regardless of the number of ticks involved.\nDollar bars are formed by sampling an observation every time a pre-defined market value is exchanged.\n2.2.

    "question": "Why is ordinary least square (OLS) regression not reliable in a\nhigh-dimensional setting?",
    "answer": "In high-dimensional settings, where the number of indicators K is\nnot small relative to the number of observations N, or perhaps even bigger than\nN, predictions based on OLS estimates often turn out to be unreliable. While the\nin-sample R2 in this case can be very high, the R2 for out-of-sample predictions can\nbe very low or even negative. The reason is that with so many covariates relative\nto the number of observations, OLS greatly overfits the data."

    "answer": "First, one sets two horizontal barriers and one vertical barrier. The\ntwo horizontal barriers are defined by profit-taking and stop-loss limits, which are\na dynamic function of estimated volatility (whether realized or implied). The third\nbarrier is defined in terms of number of bars elapsed since the position was taken\n(an expiration limit). If the upper barrier is touched first, we label the observation\nas a 1.

    "answer": "We would prefer to size positions in such way that we reserve some\ncash for the possibility that the trading signal strengthens before it weakens. Otherwise it could happen that one looses money even betting on the right side of the\nbid: Suppose that one strategy produced a sequence of bet sizes [m1,1 , m1,2 , m1,3 ] =\n[.5, 1, 0], as the market price followed a sequence [p1 , p2 , p3 ] = [1, .5, 1.25], where pt\nis the price at time t. The other strategy produced a sequence [m2,1 , m2,2 , m2,3 ] =\n[1, .5, 0], as it was forced to reduce its bet size once the market moved against the\ninitial full position. Both strategies produced forecasts that turned out to be correct\n(the price increased by 25% between p1 and p3 ), however the first strategy made\nmoney (0.5) while the second strategy lost money (-.125)."

    "question": "Why should we use Fractional Differentiation?",
    "answer": "Financial series exhibit low signal-to-noise ratios. To make matters\nworse, standard stationarity transformations, like integer differentiation, further\nreduce that signal by removing memory. Price series have memory, because every\nvalue is dependent upon a long history of previous levels.

    "question": "Why are structural breaks interesting?",
    "answer": "When a structural break takes place, most market participants are\ncaught off guard, and they will make costly mistakes. This sort of errors is the\nbasis for many profitable strategies, because the actors on the losing side will typically become aware of their mistake once it is too late. Before they accept their\nlosses, they will act irrationally, try to hold the position, and hope for a comeback.\nSometimes they will even increase a losing position, in desperation.

EXAM PREPARATION QUESTIONS BASED ON THE LECTURES\n\nAnswer: When markets are not perfect, prices are formed with partial information, and as some agents know more than others, they can exploit that informational asymmetry. It would be helpful to estimate the informational content of\nprice series, and form features on which ML algorithms can learn the likely outcomes. For example, the ML algorithm may find that momentum bets are more\nprofitable when prices carry little information, and that mean-reversion bets are\nmore profitable when prices carry a lot of information.\nQuestion 38: \"If two time series are indenpent, then their mutual information\nis -1, 0, or 1?",

  },
  {
    "question_number": 39,
    "question": "Why bubbles are formed in a low entropy market?",
    "answer": "When arbitrage mechanisms exploit the complete set of opportunities, prices instantaneously reflect the full amount of available information, becoming unpredictable (i.e., a martingale), with no discernable patterns. Conversely,\nwhen arbitrage is not perfect, prices contain incomplete amounts of information,\nwhich gives rise to predictable patterns. Patterns occur when a string contains redundant information, which enables its compression. The entropy rate of a string\ndetermines its optimal compression rate. The higher the entropy, the lower the\nredundancy and the greater the informational content. Consequently, the entropy\nof a price string tells us the degree of market efficiency at a given point in time. A\n\u201cdecompressed\u201d market is an efficient market, because price information is nonredundant. A \u201ccompressed\u201d market is an inefficient market, because price information is redundant.

This is\nproblematic in the context of portfolio optimization, because the portfolio weights\n! depends on C-1 and unless the correlations \u21e2 \u21e1 0, we must expect an unstable\nsolution to the convex optimization program.

    "question": "Are there problems when applying LASSO?",
    "answer": "Lasso performs variable selection by driving some coefficients to zero.\nHowever, when dealing with correlated predictors (multicollinearity), Lasso tends\nto arbitrarily select one variable among the correlated group and zero out the others. This can lead to instability or difficulty in interpretation if multiple correlated\nvariables are important."

EXAM PREPARATION - POSSIBLE QUESTIONS BASED ON THE STUDENTS CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nAnswer: A positive slope suggests a bullish trend, while a negative slope indicates a bearish trend. The trend\u2019s strength is determined by how far the slope is\nfrom the mean value. When the oscillator crosses above the mean value, it may be\na signal to buy or go long. Conversely, when it crosses below the mean value, it\nmay indicate a selling or shorting opportunity.\n3.27.

    "question": "What is Mean-Vairance Optimization?\"\n\n\f3.30. SAMPLING (WEIGHTED SAMPLING, ETC.)\n\n55\n\nAnswer: Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO), also known as Markowitz Portfolio Theory, is a widely used framework for constructing an optimal investment\nportfolio. MVO begins by estimating the expected returns of different assets in\nthe portfolio. These expected returns serve as a measure of the potential gain or\nloss from holding each asset. The concept of risk in MVO is represented by the\nvariance or standard deviation of the portfolio\u2019s returns. The idea is to consider\nnot only the expected return of a portfolio but also the volatility or variability of\nthose returns.\nQuestion 112: \"What is the role of the covariance matrix in Mean-Variance\nOptimization?",
    "answer": "MVO takes into account the relationships between different assets\nby considering their covariance or correlation. Positive correlations indicate that\nassets tend to move in the same direction, while negative correlations suggest they\nmove in opposite directions. Diversification benefits arise from combining assets\nwith lower or negatively correlated returns.\n3.29.
