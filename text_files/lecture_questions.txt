Questions based on the lectures
2.1. Lecture 2: Financial data structures
Chapter 2 in Advances in Financial Machine Learning by Marcos Lopez Prado.
Question 1: "What are Fundamental Data?"
Answer: Fundamental data encompasses information that can be found in
regulatory filings and business analytics. It is mostly accounting data, reported
quarterly. Fundamental data is extremely regularized and low frequency. Being
so accessible to the marketplace, it is rather unlikely that there is much value left
to be exploited. Still, it may be useful in combination with other data types.
Question 2: "What are Market Data?"
Answer: Market data includes all trading activity that takes place in an exchange or trading venue. Ideally, your data provider has given you a raw feed,
with all sorts of unstructured information, like FIX messages that allow you to
fully reconstruct the trading book, or the full collection of BWIC (bids wanted in
competition) responses.
Question 3: "What are Analytics?"
Answer: You could think of analytics as derivative data, based on an original
source, which could be fundamental, market, alternative, or even a collection of
other analytics. A positive aspect of analytics is that the signal has been extracted
for you from a raw source. The negative aspects are that analytics may be costly,
the methodology used in their production may be biased or opaque, and you will
not be the sole consumer.
Question 4: "What are Alternative Data?"
Answer: Alternative data is produced by individuals (social media, news, web
searches, etc.), business processes (transactions, corporate data, government agencies, etc.), and sensors (satellites, geolocation, weather, CCTV, etc.). Some popular
satellite image or video feeds include monitoring of tankers, tunnel traffic activity,
or parking lot occupancies. What truly characterizes alternative data is that it is
primary information, that is, information that has not made it to the other sources.

2. EXAM PREPARATION QUESTIONS BASED ON THE LECTURES

Question 5: "What are Tick Bars, Volume and Dollar Bars?"
Answer: The idea behind tick bars is straightforward: The sample variables
listed earlier (timestamp, VWAP, open price, etc.) will be extracted each time a predefined number of transactions takes place, e.g., 1,000 ticks. Volume bars sample
every time a pre-defined amount of the security’s units (shares, futures contracts,
etc.) have been exchanged. For example, we could sample prices every time a
futures contract exchanges 1,000 units, regardless of the number of ticks involved.
Dollar bars are formed by sampling an observation every time a pre-defined market value is exchanged.
2.2. Lecture 3: Regression
Sections 2.2.1 and 2.3 in S. Nagel, Machine Learning in Asset Pricing.
Question 6: "Why is ordinary least square (OLS) regression not reliable in a
high-dimensional setting?"
Answer: In high-dimensional settings, where the number of indicators K is
not small relative to the number of observations N, or perhaps even bigger than
N, predictions based on OLS estimates often turn out to be unreliable. While the
in-sample R2 in this case can be very high, the R2 for out-of-sample predictions can
be very low or even negative. The reason is that with so many covariates relative
to the number of observations, OLS greatly overfits the data.
Question 7: "What is an elastic net?"
Answer: The elastic net combines ridge and lasso penalties. Like the lasso,
the elastic net will set some coefficients to exactly zero, but it relies on variable
selection to a lesser degree than the lasso and instead also imposes some ridgelike shrinkage.
2.3. Lecture 4: Cross-Sectional Stock Returns
Section 3.1 in S. Nagel, Machine Learning in Asset Pricing.
Question 8: When looking at Cross-Sectional Stock Returns one often includes
squares and even third powers of returns. If the coefficients for squares and third
powers are small, can we neglect them?
Answer: No. The effect of the many small coefficients for squared or third
power returns can add up to a non-negligible effect size.
2.4. Lecture 5: Denoising
Denoising, Section 2.1-2.6 in Prado, Elements in Quantitative Finance.

2.6. LECTURE 6 (ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON): PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT

27

Question 9: "Consider a matrix of independent and identically distributed
random observations X, of size T ⇥ N, where the underlying process generating
the observations has zero mean and variance 2 . To which matrix applies the
Marcenko-Pastur theorem?"
Answer: The Marcenko-Pastur theorem applies to the covariance matrix
C = T -1 · Xt X .
Question 10: "What is detoning?"
Answer: Financial correlation matrices usually incorporate a market component. The reason is, it is more difficult to cluster a correlation matrix with a
strong market component, because the algorithm will struggle to find dissimilarities across clusters. By removing the market component, we allow a greater
portion of the correlation to be explained by components that affect specific subsets of the securities.
2.5. Lecture 5b (on Friday afternoon): Cross-Validation
Chapter 7 in Prado, Advances in Financial Machine Learning
Question 11: "Why does K-fold CV fail in Finance?"
Answer: Financial time series have memory. Leakage will take place when the
training set contains information that also appears in the testing set. In addition,
if a training set is directly after the test set, it means that the training set has information from the future of the test set, and thus will contaminate the test set with
information that should not be available.
Question 12: "How can you improve K-fold CV fail in Finance?"
Answer: In many cases, purging suffices to prevent leakage. For those cases
where purging is not able to prevent all leakage, we can impose an embargo on
training observations after every test set.
2.6. Lecture 6 (on Friday afternoon): Predictive Performance Assessment
Section 3.2 in S. Nagel, Machine Learning in Asset Pricing.
Question 13: "What is R2 ?"
Answer: R2 is a statistical measure in a regression model that determines the
proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable. In other words, R2 shows how well the data fit the regression
model.
Question 14: "What is the sharpe ratio?"

28

2. EXAM PREPARATION QUESTIONS BASED ON THE LECTURES

Answer: The Sharpe ratio’s numerator is the difference over time between realized, or expected, returns and a benchmark such as the risk-free rate of return or
the performance of a particular investment category. Its denominator is the standard deviation of returns over the same period of time, a measure of volatility and
risk.
2.7. Lecture 13: Labeling
Chapter 3 in Advances in Financial Machine Learning by Marcos Lopez Prado
Question 15: "What is the key flaw of the fixed-time horizon method in labeling?"
Answer: Every investment strategy has stop-loss limits, whether they are selfimposed by the portfolio manager, enforced by the risk department, or triggered
by a margin call. It is simply unrealistic to build a strategy that profits from positions that would have been stopped-out by the exchange.
Question 16: "How does the triple barrier method work in labeling?"
Answer: First, one sets two horizontal barriers and one vertical barrier. The
two horizontal barriers are defined by profit-taking and stop-loss limits, which are
a dynamic function of estimated volatility (whether realized or implied). The third
barrier is defined in terms of number of bars elapsed since the position was taken
(an expiration limit). If the upper barrier is touched first, we label the observation
as a 1. If the lower barrier is touched first, we label the observation as a -1. If the
vertical barrier is touched first, we have two choices: the sign of the return, or a 0.
Question 17: "What is meta-labeling?"
Answer: If one has a primary model that decides the side of the bet, the secondary, meta-labeling model can be used to decide the size of the bet.
2.8. Lecture 8: Clustering
Chapter 4 in Prado, Elements in Quantitative Finance.
Question 18: "What is aim of clustering?"
Answer: The goal is to separate the objects into groups (called clusters) using
the features, where intragroup similarities are maximized, and intergroup similarities are minimized. It is a form of unsupervised learning, because we do not
provide examples to assist the algorithm in solving this task. Clustering problems
appear naturally in finance, at every step of the investment process. For instance,
analysts may look for historical analogues to current events, a task that involves
developing a numerical taxonomy of events.
Question 19: How does the nested clustered optimization algorithm (NCO)
work in Portfolio Construction?

2.10. LECTURE 10: FEATURE IMPORTANCE ANALYSIS

29

Answer: The NCO algorithm has four steps: 1.) cluster the correlation matrix,
2.) compute the optimal intra-cluster allocations, 3.) compute the optimal intercluster allocations, 4.) derive the optimal weights as the dot-product of 2.) and 3.).
2.9. Lecture 9: Bet Sizing
Chapter 10 in Advances in Financial Machine Learning by Marcos Lopez Prado
Question 20: "Why is bet sizing crucial?"
Answer: We would prefer to size positions in such way that we reserve some
cash for the possibility that the trading signal strengthens before it weakens. Otherwise it could happen that one looses money even betting on the right side of the
bid: Suppose that one strategy produced a sequence of bet sizes [m1,1 , m1,2 , m1,3 ] =
[.5, 1, 0], as the market price followed a sequence [p1 , p2 , p3 ] = [1, .5, 1.25], where pt
is the price at time t. The other strategy produced a sequence [m2,1 , m2,2 , m2,3 ] =
[1, .5, 0], as it was forced to reduce its bet size once the market moved against the
initial full position. Both strategies produced forecasts that turned out to be correct
(the price increased by 25% between p1 and p3 ), however the first strategy made
money (0.5) while the second strategy lost money (-.125).
Question 21: "How does the budgeting approach work?"
Answer:
Question 22: "Can one base bet sizing on meta labeling?"
Answer: If one has a primary model that decides the side of the bet, the secondary, meta-labeling model can be used to decide the size of the bet. This approach has a couple of advantages: First, the ML algorithm that decides the bet
sizes is independent of the primary model. Second, the predicted probability can
be directly translated into bet size.
2.10. Lecture 10: Feature Importance Analysis
Chapter 6 in Prado, Elements in Quantitative Finance.
Question 23: "What is Feature Importance Analysis?"
Answer: An analysis of a machine learning models forecasts can tell us what
variables are critically involved in a particular phenomenon, what variables are redundant, what variables are useless, and how the relevant variables interact with
each other.
Question 24: "What are p-Values?"
Answer: The p-value quantifies the probability that, if the true coefficient associated with that variable is zero, we could have obtained a result equal or more
extreme than the one we have estimated.

30

2. EXAM PREPARATION QUESTIONS BASED ON THE LECTURES

Question 25: "How does the Cluster Feature Importance algorithm work?"
Answer: The clustered feature importance (CFI) algorithm involves two steps:
(1) finding the number and constituents of the clusters of features; (2) applying the
feature importance analysis on groups of similar features rather than on individual
features.
2.11. Lecture 11: Fractional Differentiation
Chapter 7 in Advances in Financial Machine Learning by Marcos Lopez Prado.
Question 26: "Why should we use Fractional Differentiation?"
Answer: Financial series exhibit low signal-to-noise ratios. To make matters
worse, standard stationarity transformations, like integer differentiation, further
reduce that signal by removing memory. Price series have memory, because every
value is dependent upon a long history of previous levels. In contrast, integer
differentiated series, like returns, have a memory cut-off, in the sense that history
is disregarded entirely after a finite sample window.
Question 27: "What is the stationarity vs. memory dilema?"
Answer: The dilemma is that returns are stationary, however memory-less,
and prices have memory, however they are non-stationary.
2.12. Lecture 12: Structural Breaks
Chapter 17 in Advances in Financial Machine Learning by Marcos Lopez Prado.
Question 28: "Why are structural breaks interesting?"
Answer: When a structural break takes place, most market participants are
caught off guard, and they will make costly mistakes. This sort of errors is the
basis for many profitable strategies, because the actors on the losing side will typically become aware of their mistake once it is too late. Before they accept their
losses, they will act irrationally, try to hold the position, and hope for a comeback.
Sometimes they will even increase a losing position, in desperation. Eventually
they will be forced to stop loss or stop out. Structural breaks offer some of the best
risk/rewards.
Question 29: "What is the objective of the CUSUM test?"
Answer: CUSUM (cumulative sum) tests test whether the cumulative forecasting errors deviates significantly from white noise.
Question 30: "What is the objective of the Explosiveness tests?"
Answer: Beyond deviation from white noise, these test whether the process
exhibits exponential growth or collapse, as this is inconsistent with a random walk
or stationary process, and it is unsustainable in the long run.

2.14. LECTURE 14: ENTROPY FEATURES

31

2.13. Lecture 13: Microstructural features
based on Chapter 19 in Advances in Financial Machine Learning by Marcos
Lopez Prado.
Question 31: "What is the content of Microstructural Datasets?"
Answer: Microstructural datasets include primary information about the auctioning process, like order cancellations, double auction book, queues, partial fills,
aggressor side, corrections, replacements, etc. The main source is Financial Information eXchange (FIX) messages, which can be purchased from exchanges.
Question 32: "What is the role of PIN (probability of informed trading)?"
Answer: PIN explains the bid-ask spread as the consequence of a sequential
strategic decision between liquidity providers (market makers) and position takers
(informed traders). The bid-ask spreads are a function of liquidity.
Question 33: "What are Quote stuffers?"
Answer: They engage in “latency arbitrage.” Their strategy involves overwhelming an exchange with messages, with the sole intention of slowing down
competing algorithms, which are forced to parse messages that only the originators know can be ignored.
Question 34: "What are Quote danglers?"
Answer: This strategy sends quotes that force a squeezed trader to chase a
price against her interests.
Question 35: "What are Liquidity squeezers?"
Answer: When a distressed large investor is forced to unwind her position,
predatory algorithms trade in the same direction, draining as much liquidity as
possible. As a result, prices overshoot and they make a profit.
Question 36: "What are Pack hunters?"
Answer: Predators hunting independently become aware of one another’s activities, and form a pack in order to maximize the chances of triggering a cascading
effect.
2.14. Lecture 14: Entropy features
Chapter 18 in Advances in Financial Machine Learning by Marcos Lopez Prado.
Question 37: "Why is it interesting to know whether or not a time series contains information?"

32

2. EXAM PREPARATION QUESTIONS BASED ON THE LECTURES

Answer: When markets are not perfect, prices are formed with partial information, and as some agents know more than others, they can exploit that informational asymmetry. It would be helpful to estimate the informational content of
price series, and form features on which ML algorithms can learn the likely outcomes. For example, the ML algorithm may find that momentum bets are more
profitable when prices carry little information, and that mean-reversion bets are
more profitable when prices carry a lot of information.
Question 38: "If two time series are indenpent, then their mutual information
is -1, 0, or 1?"
Answer: Zero.
Question 39: "Why bubbles are formed in a low entropy market?"
Answer: When arbitrage mechanisms exploit the complete set of opportunities, prices instantaneously reflect the full amount of available information, becoming unpredictable (i.e., a martingale), with no discernable patterns. Conversely,
when arbitrage is not perfect, prices contain incomplete amounts of information,
which gives rise to predictable patterns. Patterns occur when a string contains redundant information, which enables its compression. The entropy rate of a string
determines its optimal compression rate. The higher the entropy, the lower the
redundancy and the greater the informational content. Consequently, the entropy
of a price string tells us the degree of market efficiency at a given point in time. A
“decompressed” market is an efficient market, because price information is nonredundant. A “compressed” market is an inefficient market, because price information is redundant. Bubbles are formed in compressed (low entropy) markets.
2.15. Lecture 15: Distance metrics
Chapter 3 in Prado, Elements in Quantitative Finance.
Question 40: "What is the role of Conditional Entropy H[X|Y]?"
Answer: H[X|Y] is the uncertainty we expect in X if we are told the value of Y.
Question 41: "What is the role of Mutual information I[X, Y]?"
Answer: Mutual information is defined as the decrease in uncertainty (or informational gain) in X that results from knowing the value of Y.
Question 42: "What is the role of Variation of information?"
Answer: This measure can be interpreted as the uncertainty we expect in one
variable if we are told the value of the other.
2.16. Lecture 16: Porfolio construction
Chapter 7, in Prado, Elements in Quantitative Finance.

2.17. LECTURE 17: HIERARCHICAL RISK PARITY

33

Question 43: "What is Markowitz’s Curse?"
Answer: When securities within a portfolio are highly correlated, the covariance matrix C has a high condition number, and the values of C-1 explode. This is
problematic in the context of portfolio optimization, because the portfolio weights
! depends on C-1 and unless the correlations ⇢ ⇡ 0, we must expect an unstable
solution to the convex optimization program. In other words, Markowitz’s solution is guaranteed to be numerically stable only if ⇢ ⇡ 0, which is precisely the
case when we don’t need it! The reason we needed Markowitz was to handle the
⇢ 6⇡ 0 case, but the more we need Markowitz, the more numerically unstable is the
estimation of !. This is Markowitz’s curse.
2.17. Lecture 17: Hierarchical Risk Parity
Chapter 16 in Advances in Financial Machine Learning by Marcos Lopez Prado.
Question 44: "What are three known issues with Markowitz’s Critical Line
Algorithm (CLA)?"
Answer: Instability (small deviations in the forecasted returns will cause CLA
to produce very different portfolios), concentration (a consequence of pursuing the
optimal asset allocation), and under-performance (even naive equally-weighted
portfolios have been shown to beat mean-variance portfolios).
Question 45: Why is the hierarchical risk parity portfolio more resistent against
shocks than the CLA and the IVP (inverse variance portfolio)?
Answer: Shocks affecting a specific investment penalize CLA’s concentration.
Shocks involving several correlated investments penalize IVP’s ignorance of the
correlation structure. HRP provides better protection against both common and
idiosyncratic shocks by finding a compromise between diversification across all
investments and diversification across clusters of investments at multiple hierarchical levels.

Exam preparation - Possible questions based on the
students contributions
The following sections are based, often literally, on the slides contributed by
students for the exercise class. This chapter does not provide a proper presentation
of any of the subjects; it is just a collection of questions and possible answers.
These are just possible answers suggest in the presentations, there are many other
ways to correctly answer the questions. This list is work in progress, it will be
updated regularly.
3.1. Denoising
• Priyanka Teja Ravi,
• Ramiscan Yakar
• Tolga Keskinoglu.
Question 1: "Why should we use denoising?"
Answer: Financial data is notorious for having low a signal-to-noise ratio. Empirical covariance matrices are often numerically ill-conditioned. It is not recommended to work with these matrices directly, without treatment.
Question 2: "What is the essence of the Marcenko-Pastur theorem?"
Answer: The Marcenko-Pastur theorem gives the distribution of eigenvalues
associated with a random covariance matrix. By adjusting this distribution, we
can discriminate between eigenvalues associated with the signal and eigenvalues
associated with noise. Denoising reduces the condition number of the covariance
matrix by increasing the lowest eigenvalue.
Question 3: Why should we allow an adjustable factor q = N/T ?
Answer: Intuitively, correlated samples are somehow redundant and the covariance matrix should behave as if we had observed not T samples but an effective number T 0 < T .
Question 4: What is the usage of detoning?
Answer: Removing the market components present in the covariance matrix
reinforces the more subtle signals hidden beneath the market.

3. EXAM PREPARATION - POSSIBLE QUESTIONS BASED ON THE STUDENTS CONTRIBUTIONS

3.2. Cross Validation
• Rabin BK
• Yatin Arora.
Question 5: "What is k-fold cross validation?"
Answer: This approach involves randomly dividing the set of observations
into k groups, or folds, of approximately equal size. The one fold is treated as a
validation set, and the method is fit on the remaining k - 1 folds.
Question 6: "Why cross validation fails when applied to financial time series?"
Answer: There are several reasons: i.) Financial data exhibits patterns and dependencies that violate the assumption of CV; ii.) Leakage takes place when the
training set contains information that also appears in the testing set. This is the
case due to memory contained in financial time series. iii.) Financial data are influenced by various external factors and market dynamics that change over time. iv.)
The training set may contain information of the testing set, if the former is in the
future of the latter.
Question 7: "What is leakage?"
Answer: Leakage means that information is revealed to the model that gives
it an unrealistic advantage to make better predictions. This could happen when
test data is leaked into the training set, or when data from the future is leaked to
the past. Any time that a model is given information that it shouldn’t have access
to when it is making predictions in real time, there is leakage.
Question 8: "How can one reduce the likelihood of leakage?"
Answer: Filtering data: remove any observations where label Yi is dependent
on information used to determine another label Yj for j belongs to the testing set.
3.2.1. Question 9: "How can one avoiding Overfitting?"
Answer: Method 1: Early Stopping of Base Estimators, monitoring the performance during training and stopping when performance on a validation set begins
to degrade;
Method 2: Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) of classifiers with diversity controls training multiple classifiers on subsets of the data and combine their predictions ensuring that individual classifiers are as diverse as possible.
3.2.2. Question 10: "Which sets should be purged in k-fold cross validation"
Answer: One should purge from the training set all observations whose labels
overlap in time with those labels included in the testing set.
3.2.3. Question 11: "What is the role of an embargo set?"

3.4. TREND INDICATORS

37

Answer: It is imposed on training observations after every test set where purging is not able to prevent all leakage.
3.3. Momentum indicators (KAMA, AOI, RSI)
• Amit Jadhav (23036144)
• Apurwa Agrawal (23161645)
• Rahul Ramraje (23081510)
Question 12: "What is role of KAMA (Kaufman Adaptive Moving Average)?"
Answer: KAMA is a moving average designed to account for market noise or
volatility. It has a lower number of false signals in comparison to other types of
moving averages.
Question 13: "What information can be extracted from the Awesome Oscillator?"
Answer: The Awesome Oscillator provides the difference between SMA(5)
and SMA(34); SMA stands for Simple Moving Average. It helps forecast market momentum and whether the prevailing trend will continue or reverse. When
above the zero line, the market is bullish, and when below the zero line, the market
is bearish 1. The indicator’s bars can provide buy or sell signals, and traders often use patterns such as the saucer, twin peaks, and zero-line crossover to identify
bullish or bearish trends.
Question 14: "What information can be extracted from the Relative Strength
Index (RSI)?"
Answer: RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security’s recent price
changes. It is used to identify overvalued or undervalued prices of stocks. RSI
assigns stocks a value between 0 and 100.
3.4. Trend indicators
• Ashik Shivanna Gowda
• Mohit Kumar
• Sayantani Sensharma
• Viranaya Tapesh Shah
Question 15: "What is role of moving averages?"
Answer: The primary focus is on averaging prices over time to smoothing out
market fluctuations and to identify trends.
Question 16: "What is role of oscillators?"
Answer: Fluctuations around a central value or within a range are used to
identify momentum, trend strength, and overbought or oversold conditions.

38

3. EXAM PREPARATION - POSSIBLE QUESTIONS BASED ON THE STUDENTS CONTRIBUTIONS

Question 17: "What are SMA, WMA and EMA?"
Answer: Simple Moving Average (SMA): An upward moving SMA indicates an
uptrend. A downward moving SMA suggests a downtrend. A 200-bar SMA is
commonly used as an indicator of the long-term trend. A 50-bar SMA helps gauge
the intermediate trend. Shorter period SMAs can be utilized to identify short-term
trends.
Weighted Moving Average (WMA): WMA provides a more sensitive indicator
that responds more closely to the latest price changes compared to the SMA.
Exponential Moving Average (EMA): EMA calculation incorporates the previous
EMA value, ensuring that all past price data is included. Recent price actions have
a more significant influence on EMA, with older data having a minimal impact.
Question 18: "What are MACDs (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)?"
Answer: The MACD indicator is a collection of three time series calculated
from historical price data: i.) MACD Line: EMAfast - EMAslow ; ii.) Signal Line:
EMA of the MACD Line; iii.) MACD Histogram: MACD Line – Signal Line.
Question 19: "What are Detrended Pricing Oscillators (DPOs)?"
Answer: DPO = Price - SMA(Price, N).
DPO is designed to remove the trend from a price, allowing you to more easily
identify cycles and overbought or oversold levels in a security.
Question 20: "What are PSARs (Parabolic Stop and Reverse)?"
Answer: Parabolic Stop and Reverse (PSAR) is a trailing stop-based trading
system. PSAR for the next period is calculated based on whether the trend is
upward or downward. Parabolic SAR System: Acts as a "stop and reverse" mechanism. Calculates a stop level for each period. Trade direction reverses when the
stop is hit. Ensures continuous market investment.
3.5. Tick, Volume, and Dollar bars
• Moritz Link,
• Ahmed Ibrahim,
• Brijesh Mandaliya.
Question 21: "What are time bars?"
Answer: A graphical representation of stock prices over a time interval. Each
bar represents the opening, high, low, and closing prices for that time interval.
Question 22: "What are tick bars?"

3.6. VOLUME INDICATORS

39

Answer: Tick bars are created by aggregating specific amount of actions into
bars. Each bar represents the opening, high, low, and closing prices for that action
interval. The number of ticks in each bar will vary depending on the liquidity of
the asset and the volatility of the market. It provides a detailed view of market
activity, helping traders analyze short-term trends and make quicker decisions.
Question 23: "What are volume bars?"
Answer: Volume bars are created by aggregating trades into fixed-size volume
shares, such as 100 contracts or 1000 contracts. Each bar represents the opening,
high, low, and closing prices for that volume interval. The height of the volume
bar will vary depending on the size of the contracts and the liquidity of the asset.
Question 24: "What are dollar bars?"
Answer: Dollar bars are calculated by multiplying the volume data with the
price (in dollars) and aggregating it into fixed-size dollar intervals, such as $10.000
or $100.000. A dollar graph in finance represents the total value of traded securities
in dollars rather than just the number of shares. It helps investors assess the overall
monetary impact of trading activity, providing insights into market liquidity and
the significance of price movement.
3.6. Volume indicators
• Mohammad Ayaz Alam (23196606)
• Bijay Marasini (23162258)
Question 25: "What is the Money Flow Index (MFI)?"
Answer: Money Flow index is an oscillator that uses both volume and price
to measure buying and selling pressure. MFI is also known as Volume-Weighted
RSI (Relative Strength Index). It evaluates the inflow and outflow of money in
a security over a specified period. MFI above 80 suggests a potential overbought
condition, indicating a possible price reversal. MFI below 20 indicates a potential
oversold condition, indicating a possible price reversal.
Question 26: "What is the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)?"
Answer: VWAP is used to identify liquidity points. VWAP is a single-day
indicator and restarts at the open of each new trading day. It gives the volumeweighted average price of a security.
Question 27: "What is Anchored VWAP?"
Answer: Anchored VWAP is a trading indicator that provides the average
price of a security from a specific starting point (anchor) factoring in price and
volume.

40

3. EXAM PREPARATION - POSSIBLE QUESTIONS BASED ON THE STUDENTS CONTRIBUTIONS

3.7. Volume indicators
• Ajay Sah (24172531)
• Pallavi Ghimire (23221174)
• Rachana Kafle (23159096)
Question 28: "Why would one use Volume Indicators?"
Answer: Volume indicators reveal crucial information regarding trading activity of a financial instrument, such as stocks, bonds, or commodities. They offer
insights into the strength or weakness of a price movement by measuring the number of shares or contracts traded over a specific period.
Question 29: "What are major reasons for the need of volume indicators?"
Answer: Confirmation of Price Trends, Identification of Reversals, Breakout
Confirmation, Divergence Analysis, Early Warning Signals, Confirmation of Trend
Continuation.
Question 30: What is the usage of the Chaikin Money Flow indicator?
Answer: The Chaikin Money Flow indicator measures accumulation and distribution of a security over time. It generates buy, sell, and confirmation signals
through bullish and bearish convergences and divergences as well as crossovers
through the zero line. Compared to Accumulation/Distribution and On-Balance
Volume, which focus on cumulative volume, CMF emphasizes the relationship
between closing prices and intraday highs and lows.
Question 31: Where can Chaikin Money Flow be useful?
Answer: Assessing Buying and Selling Pressure (designed to reflect the relationship between price and volume, providing insights into the money flow direction). Confirmation of Price Movements (useful for confirming the strength of a
price trend). Divergence Analysis (may offer insights into potential trend reversals or weakening trends). Evaluating Market Sentiment (High CMF values may
indicate bullish sentiment, while low values may suggest bearish sentiment). Customizing Timeframes (Different timeframes may reveal different aspects of money
flow dynamics).
Question 32: How would you interpret Chaikin Money Flow indicator?
Answer: A very low CMF value (well below zero) indicates selling pressure
in the market. A divergence occurs when a price moves in a certain direction but
the CMF does not move in the same direction. If a divergence exists over a longer
period of time, this should be understood as a clear indication of an impending
trend change. A value above zero is a positive CMF. A value below zero is referred
to as a negative CMF
Question 33: What are the shortcomings of Chaikin Money Flow indicator?

3.8. MOMENTUM INDICATORS

41

Answer: Sensitivity to price fluctuations - can be less reliable during volatile
periods or when the trend of a security is flattening. However, it can be used in
combination with other technical indicators that can provide further information.
Question 34: What is the Accumulation Distribution Index (ADI)?
Answer: The ADI combines price and volume to show how money may be
flowing into or out of a stock. Positive ADI values indicate accumulation, suggesting that the stocks is being accumulated or bought. Negative ADI values suggest
distribution, indicating that the stocks is being sold or distributed.
Question 35: What is On-Balance Volume (OBV)?
Answer: OBV calculates the buying and selling pressure as a cumulative indicator. It sums up volume on up days and subtracts volume on down days. Relation between the current trend and the OBV reflects the upcoming price movements. It generates a bullish divergence, when OBV is rising and price is falling.
It generates a bearish divergence when OBV is falling and price is rising.

• Kamalkhumar Lakshmanan Sharavanan,
• Darren Morris Babu,
• Karthikeyan Mathavan,
• Avani Shaileshkumar Popat.
Question 36: "What is the Average Directional Index (ADX)?"
Answer: The ADX indicator helps traders gauge the strength of price movements over time. It is plotted as a single line with values ranging from 0 to 100,
with higher values indicating stronger trends. The ADX is non-directional, meaning it measures trend strength without regard to the direction of the trend.
The ADX consists of three lines: an ADX line, a +DI line, and a -DI line. The
+DI line measures the strength of upward trends, while the -DI line measures the
strength of downward trends. The ADX line is plotted above the DMI lines and
is used to assess the overall strength of the trend. The ADX increases when the
positive directional indicator (+DI) surpasses the negative directional indicator (DI) and vice versa, indicating a stronger trend.
Question 37: "What does the Average Directional Index (ADX) tell you?"
Answer: ADX values above 25 indicate strong trends, while values below 20
indicate weak trends. ADX values below 20 suggest a trendless market, indicating
a less favourable time for entering trades. Crossovers of the +DI and - DI lines,
combined with ADX readings above 20, can signal potential buy or sell opportunities.

Question 38: "What does the Rate of Change (ROC) indicator tell you?"
Answer: The Rate of Change (ROC) indicator is a pure momentum oscillator
that helps traders identify the speed at which the price of a security is changing.
Question 39: "What does the Stochastic RSI indicator tell you?"
Answer: Stochastic RSI is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum and identify overbought and oversold conditions in the market. The values of StochRSI are derived from the RSI. Essentially, a StochRSI is the observation
of change in RSI values w.r.t prices. Unlike the traditional momentum indicators, where 70 and 30 indicate the turning points, the StochRSI uses 80 and 20
as the price overbought and oversold, respectively. StochRSI surpassing 80% signals an overbought market condition. It suggests an impending downward turn.
StochRSI below 20% signals an oversold market condition. It suggests an impending upward turn.
Question 40: "Why is the Stochastic RSI indicator more effective than RSI?"
Answer: Stochastic RSI was created to increase the sensitivity, and reliability
of regular RSI for better identifying overbought or oversold conditions. StochRSI
moves very quickly from overbought to oversold, or vice versa, while the RSI is
a much slower-moving indicator. StochRSI is the second derivative of price. It is
looking at how the RSI is changing, not the original price.
3.9. Simple, Exponential, Weighted and Hull Moving Averages
• Bilal Ahmad Butt
Question 41: How are SMAs computed?
Answer: Simple moving averages give equal weight to all data points in the
calculation, regardless of their age. This results in less responsiveness to recent
price movements.
Question 42: How are EMAs computed?
Answer: Exponential moving averages overcome the limitations of SMAs by
assigning greater weights to recent data points. As a result, it reacts faster to price
changes. However, overweighting recent dates creates a bias that leads to more
false alarms.
Question 43: How are Weighted Moving Averages computed?
Answer: Weighted Moving Averages give different weights to data points in
the sample window. Weighting the most current price data as more significant
creates the potential for the line to change suddenly and sharply due to volatility.
Question 44: How are Hull Moving Averages computed?

3.11. BACKTESTING WITH INDICATORS

43

Answer: Hull Moving Average uses two different weighted moving averages
(WMAs) of price, and a third WMA to smooth the raw moving average. The HMA
reduces lag by placing additional weight on more recent values. Offsetting one
WMA with another WMA that covers only the most recent half of the specified
timeframe. Smoothing uses another WMA with even fewer periods (the square
root), further weighting the average towards the most recent data.
3.10. Trading strategy
• Pratik Raut,
• Justins Pulpakunnel Varkey
• Venkata Sai Swetha Gatamaneni.
Question 45: "What are support levels?"
Answer: These are price levels where buyers are more likely to step in and
buy, preventing the price from falling further. Support levels can act as temporary
floors for the price. Breakouts below support levels can signal a shift in trend to
bearish.
Question 46: "What are resistance levels?"
Answer: A price level where sellers are more likely to step in and sell, preventing the price from rising further. Support levels can act as a temporary ceiling for
the price. Breakouts above resistance levels can signal a shift in trend to bullish.
Question 47: Why Use Pivot Points?
Answer: Pivot points can be used to: Identify potential trading opportunities;
Set stop-loss and profit-target orders; Manage risk; Develop trading strategies.
Question 48: How to use Pivot Points?
Answer: Pivot points can be used to identify support and resistance levels on
a chart. These levels can then be used to generate trading signals.
Question 49: What is Super Trend?
Answer: Super Trend is an indicator that uses price movement and volatility to indicate trend direction, providing clear buy or sell signals with colourchanging line on price charts.

3.12. Feature Importance
• Parwiz Ibrahimi (23049130)
• Pragati Biradar (23072456)
• Shivam Singh (23072210)
• Srusti Ujjini Math (23075690)
Question 51: "What is Mean Decrease Impurity (MDI)?"
Answer: MDI is a fast, explanatory / importance (in sample, IS) method specific to tree based, RF. At each node of each decision tree, the selected feature splits
the subset it received in such a way that impurity is decreased. The idea is that
features that consistently lead to lower impurity are considered more important.
For each decision tree, at each node where a split is made, the impurity decrease
caused by that split is calculated. The overall importance of a feature is the sum of
impurity decreases across all nodes where that feature is used for splitting, averaged over all trees.
Question 52: "What is Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA)?"
Answer: The algorithm fits a machine learning model and drives its crossvalidation score on the Original data set (X, Y) For each feature f form X, the algorithm randomly permutes (shuffles) the feature value to create a modified feature
matrix Xf. The algorithm measures the cross-validation performance on the modified data set (Xf, Y). The importance of feature f equals the difference between the
original and modified cross-validation scores. MDA is Out-Of-Sample (OOS).
Question 53: "What is Single Feature Importance?"
Answer: Single Feature Importance (SFI) is a method used in predictive modelling that evaluates the importance of individual features (or variables) in making
predictions. It computes the OOS performance score of each feature in isolation.
Question 54: "What is SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)?"
Answer: SHAP values, rooted in cooperative game theory, offer a method for
equitably distributing the impact of each feature on a machine learning model’s
output. SHAP values offer insights into how individual features contribute to
each prediction. The idea behind SHAP feature importance by aggregating SHAP
values across all instances in the dataset, you can determine the global importance
of each feature.

3.14. VOLATILITY INDICATORS

45

Question 55: "What is LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)?"
Answer: LIME is a technique used in machine learning to provide local and
interpretable explanations for individual predictions. LIME focuses on creating
locally faithful and interpretable models around specific instances. LIME helps
bridge the gap between these opaque models and human interpretability. Ultimately, the choice between LIME and SHAP depends on the specific interpretability needs, the nature of the machine learning model, and whether the focus is on
local or global explanations.
3.13. Regression (R2 , MSE, Ridge, Lasso)
• Aditi Singh (23217770)
• Deeksha Vishnoi (23160464)
• Nishant Mishra (23178030)
Question 56: "What is role of R2 (coefficient and determination)?"
Answer: The R2 coefficient represents the proportion of the variance for the
dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in a regression
model. It ranges from 0 to 1. It does not indicate whether a regression model is
adequate.
Question 57: "What is role of the Mean Square Error (MSE)?"
Answer: MSE is the average of the squares of the errors or deviations. It measures the quality of an estimator. A lower MSE indicates a closer fit of the model
to the data. MSE alone may not be sufficient for assessing the quality of a model.
Question 58: "What is Lasso?"
Answer: Lasso stands for "least absolute shrinkage and selection operator."
The shrinkage term penalizes the absolute size of the coefficients, encouraging
some of them to become exactly zero. It facilitates feature selection, identifying
and excluding irrelevant or redundant features.
Question 59: "What is Ridge Regression?"
Answer: Extends linear regression by adding a penalty term. The regularization parameter (alpha) controls the strength of regularization. Alpha decides the
amount of regularization. A small alpha implies little or no regularization, making Ridge Regression approach ordinary linear regression. A large alpha leads to
stronger regularization, shrinking coefficients and preventing overfitting.

Question 60: "What is Mass Index (MI)?"
Answer: It uses the high-low range to identify trend reversals based on range
expansions. It identifies range bulges that can foreshadow a reversal of the current
trend."
Question 61: "What is Keltner Channel (KC)?"
Answer: Keltner Channels are a trend following indicator used to identify reversals with channel breakouts and channel direction. Channels can also be used
to identify overbought and oversold levels when the trend is flat.
Question 62: "What is the Relative Volatility Index (RVI)?"
Answer: RVI, or Relative Volatility Index, measures the relative strength of
a security’s recent gains against losses. It is essential for understanding market
volatility and predicting potential trend reversals.
Question 63: "What is the True Range Volatility Indicator?"
Answer: True Range measures the range of price movement considering highs,
lows, and closes. It provides a comprehensive measure of price movement, aiding
in volatility assessment.
Question 64: "What are Bollinger Bands?"
Answer: Bollinger Bands comprise three components: the upper band, lower
band, and middle band. The middle band represents the 20-day or 20-bar moving
average. Meanwhile, the upper band is calculated as the middle band’s value plus
twice the standard deviation, and the lower band is determined as the middle
band’s value minus twice the standard deviation.
Question 65: "How to use Bollinger bands?"
Answer: Overbought signals: When price action is close to the upper band,
the current price of the instrument is considered high relative to recent prices.
If they cross the upper band, traders consider the instrument to be overbought.
Oversold signals: When price moves close to the lower band, the current price
is considered low relative to recent prices. If they cross the lower band, traders
consider the instrument to be oversold.
Question 66: "What are Donchian Channels?"
Answer: Upper Band: Marks the highest price over a specified period. Lower
Band: Represents the lowest price over a defined timeframe. Middle Line (Centerline): Typically, a moving average, often set to 20 periods.
Question 67: "How to use Donchian Channels?"

3.15. TREND INDICATORS

47

Answer: Breakout Signals: Upward Breakout: When prices move above the
upper band, it may signal a potential upward breakout or trend continuation.
Downward Breakout: When prices move below the lower band, it may indicate
a potential downward breakout or trend reversal.
3.15. Trend Indicators
• Emin Mammadov
• Amirahmad Amjadi.
Question 68: "What is the Triple Exponential Average (TRIX)?"
Answer: The triple exponential average (TRIX) indicator is an oscillator used
to identify oversold and overbought markets, and it can also be used as a momentum indicator. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an
overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. It filters out market noise using the triple exponential average calculation. TRIX reads
market momentum: crossing above zero signals a strengthening trend for buying,
while crossing below indicates a weakening trend, suggesting potential selling opportunities.
Question 69: "What is the meaning of Signal Line Crossing for the TRIX?"
Answer: Traders use a signal line, a delayed moving average of TRIX, for optimal entry. A buy signal happens when TRIX crosses the line from below, and
a sell signal occurs when it crosses from above. This works in trends (indicating retracements or trend resumption) and ranges (confirming support/resistance
zones).
Question 70: "What is the Average Directional Index (ADX)?"
Answer: The average directional index (ADX) is a technical analysis indicator
used by traders to determine the strength of a trend. The trend can be either up or
down, and this is shown by two accompanying indicators, the negative directional
indicator (-DI) and the positive directional indicator (+DI). The ADX commonly
includes three separate lines. These are used to help assess whether a trade should
be taken long or short, or if a trade should be taken at all.
Question 71: "What is the role of the Aroon indicator?"
Answer: The Aroon indicator is a technical indicator that is used to identify
trend changes in the price of an asset, as well as the strength of that trend. In
essence, the indicator measures the time between highs and the time between lows
over a time period. The idea is that strong uptrends will regularly see new highs,
and strong downtrends will regularly see new lows. The indicator signals when
this is happening, and when it isn’t.
Question 72: "What is the Commodity Channel Index (CCI)?"

48

3. EXAM PREPARATION - POSSIBLE QUESTIONS BASED ON THE STUDENTS CONTRIBUTIONS

Answer: The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is an oscillator used to help determine when an investment vehicle is reaching a condition of being overbought
or oversold. It assesses price trend direction and strength, allowing traders to determine if they want to enter or exit a trade. It measures the difference between the
current price and the historical average price. It is unbounded oscillator, meaning
it can go higher or lower indefinitely. Overbought and oversold levels are typically determined for each individual asset by looking at historical extreme CCI
levels where the price reversed from.

• Md Norul Gofran (22951199)
• Kasvi Dua (23048230)
• Nikhil Panchal (23072507)
Question 73: "What kind of problems are caused by multi-linearity?"
Answer:
• Uncertainty in Variable Selection: Identifying the set of significant variables
becomes challenging as the model results fluctuate, making it difficult to
determine which variables truly contribute to the dependent variable’s
behaviour.
• Unstable Coefficient Estimates: The coefficients of the independent variables are not stable, making it difficult to interpret the model’s findings.
It becomes unclear how changes in one variable will affect the dependent
variable, as the impact is influenced by the correlated variables.
• Overfitting and Poor Generalization: The unstable nature of the model can
lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data
but poorly on new data. This is because the model has essentially memorized the correlations between the variables rather than capturing the
true underlying relationships.
3.18. Clustering
• Anuraag Mishra (23076160)
• Behnam Babaeian (23177836)
• Elaheh Ghorbani (23208589)
Question 74: Name a few types of of clustering:

3.18. CLUSTERING

49

Answer:
• Partitioning: Construct various partitions and then evaluate them by
some criterion. Like: k-means.
• Hierarchical Clustering: Create a hierarchical decomposition of the set of
data using some criterion. Like: AGNES.
• Density-based Clustering: Based on connectivity and density functions,
for example DBSCAN.
• Grid-based Clustering: Based on a multiple-level granularity structure,
for example CLIQUE.
• Frequent-pattern-based Clustering: Based on the analysis of frequent patterns, for example p-Cluster.
Question 75: "Recall two hierarchical clustering methods. "
Answer: AGNES (agglomerative) merges nodes that have the most similarity
(or least dissimilarity). It goes on in a non-descending fashion. Eventually all
nodes belong to the same cluster. AGNES can be terminated when a pre-defined
number of clusters is reached. DIANA is a divisive hierarchical clustering method.
Question 76: How do you interpret a Dendogram?
Answer: The hight of linkage lines reveals the distance between previous clusters.
Question 77: What is Dendogram cutting?
Answer: The dendrogram resulting from the hierarchical clustering process
can be cut at a certain height. Clusters below this height are considered the final clusters. This height corresponds to a specific level of dissimilarity or linkage
distance.
Question 80: What is the role of the Sharpe ratio?
Answer: The Sharpe ratio is a measure of the risk-adjusted performance of an
investment or a portfolio. It is widely used in finance to evaluate the return of an
investment relative to its risk.
Question 81: Why should one diversify risk?
Answer: Assets may react differently to various economic, market, or geopolitical factors. Thus, in a diversified portfolio, the potential losses from underperforming or volatile investments may be offset by gains in other parts of the
portfolio. A well-diversified portfolio should optimize the trade-off between risk
and return.

Answer: An outlier refers to a data point that exhibits a substantial deviation
from most of the dataset. In other words, it refers to a data point that differs
significantly from other observations.
Question 90: "What is the Interquartile Range (IQR) Method?"
Answer: The Interquartile Range (IQR) Method identifies outliers by using
the statistical spread between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) of
a dataset, focusing on the middle 50% of the data distribution.
3.22. Backtesting on Synthetic Data
• Posh Raj Dahal.
Question 91: "Why would you use synthetic data?"
Answer: Historical data is limited, and it may not be representative of future
market conditions. Trying to discover the optimal thresholds by brute force with
limited Fhistorical data easily leads to overfitting.
3.23. Sample-Weights
• Kshitij Dua (23032110)
• Abhishek Datar (23071152)
Question 92: "What is the role of Sample-Weights?"
Answer: Sample weights allow us to assign different weights to instances based
on their significance, ensuring that the model does not overlook rare but critical
events.
Question 93: "What is Return-Based Sample Weighting?"
Answer: Return-Based Sample Weighting assign higher weights to data points
that are associated with larger price movements or returns, assuming that these
instances are more informative for training the model.
Question 94: "What are T-Values?"
Answer: In statistics, the t-statistic is the ratio of the departure of the estimated
value of a parameter from its hypothesized value to its standard error.
Question 95: "What is T-Value-Based Sample Weighting?"
Answer: T-Value-Based Sample Weighting priorizes observations that have
more significant impact on the model’s performance according to statistical tests.

• Khaled Hassan Sazzad (22983289)
• Orko Dutta (23021026)
• Nuren Samia (23045232)
Question 96: "What is the purpose of the Bollinger bands?"
Answer: The purpose of the Bollinger bands is to identify market highs and
lows. The upper band represents high pricing, while the lower band represents
low prices. A straightforward moving average between the two other bands is
provided by the middle band. When the bands are examined, it helps identify
patterns and compares price activity to other indications so that conclusions about
the market’s movement at that moment may be made concurrently.
Question 97: "Can Bollinger bands be used to evaluate market volatility?"
Answer: Bollinger bands adjust dynamically to market conditions by expanding during periods of high volatility and contracting during lower volatility. This
makes them a valuable tool for assessing the volatility of an asset or market.
Question 98: "Can Bollinger bands identify a price range?"
Answer: Bollinger bands serve as a graphical representation of price volatility
around a moving average. Traders use them to gauge the upper and lower bounds
of a price range, helping identify potential overbought and oversold levels.
Question 99: "What is the role of Bollinger bands in trend analysis?"
Answer: Bollinger bands assist in identifying the direction and strength of a
trend. When prices consistently hug the upper band, it might indicate a strong
uptrend, while prices persistently touching the lower band might suggest a strong
downtrend.
Question 100: "What is the role of Bollinger bands in identifying entry and
exit points?"
Answer: Traders often use Bollinger Bands to determine entry and exit points
in trades. For instance, when prices touch or exceed the bands, it might signal
potential reversal or continuation of a trend, helping traders make decisions about
buying or selling.
Question 101: "Do Bollinger bands indicate support and resistance levels?"
Answer: The upper and lower bands can act as dynamic support and resistance levels. When the price reaches these levels, traders might anticipate a bounce
or reversal.

• Parth Ghinaiya
• Nikhil Maguwala.
Question 102: "How does Long Short-Term Memory work?"
Answer: The input gate, forget gate, and output gate in LSTM regulate the
flow of information, enabling the network to selectively store, discard, and retrieve
information at different time steps.
Question 103: "What are the advantages of Long Short-Term Memory?"
Answer: LSTM excels in modeling and predicting sequential data due to its
ability to capture long-term dependencies, adapt to variable-length sequences, and
handle vanishing / exploding gradient problems.
3.26. Regression (Ridge, Lasso, Linear Regression Indicator)
• Nilay Khare (23108107)
• Vipul Tank (23185940)
• Anmol Tiwari (23177959)
Question 104: "How does Ridge Regression work?"
Answer: The added penalty term in Ridge Regression penalizes the coefficients based on their squared values. This penalty encourages smaller coefficients
and prevents them from becoming too large. As a result, Ridge Regression shrinks
the coefficients toward zero but does not force them to be exactly zero.
Question 105: "How does LASSO work?"
Answer: The penalty term added in Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection
Operator (LASSO) is based on the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients
of the regression variables, multiplied by a constant lambda ( ). The goal of this
penalty term is to shrink the coefficients of less important variables all the way to
zero, effectively performing variable selection and regularization.
Question 106: "Are there problems when applying LASSO?"
Answer: Lasso performs variable selection by driving some coefficients to zero.
However, when dealing with correlated predictors (multicollinearity), Lasso tends
to arbitrarily select one variable among the correlated group and zero out the others. This can lead to instability or difficulty in interpretation if multiple correlated
variables are important.
Question 107: "How does the Linear Regression Indicator work?"

54

3. EXAM PREPARATION - POSSIBLE QUESTIONS BASED ON THE STUDENTS CONTRIBUTIONS

Answer: A positive slope suggests a bullish trend, while a negative slope indicates a bearish trend. The trend’s strength is determined by how far the slope is
from the mean value. When the oscillator crosses above the mean value, it may be
a signal to buy or go long. Conversely, when it crosses below the mean value, it
may indicate a selling or shorting opportunity.
3.27. Bet-Sizing
• Annick Faal,
• Bhavana Srinivas,
• Charitha Ramaiah
• Tejashree Ananda Kumar.
Question 108: "What is the role of bet sizing?"
Answer: Bet sizing typically refers to determining the amount of resources
or investment to allocate to a particular prediction or decision. For example, bet
sizing could refer to determining how much capital to allocate to a specific investment or trade based on the confidence level of a predictive model.
Question 109: "What is the role of bet sizing in risk managment?"
Answer: Bet sizing is all about having a well-thought-out risk management
strategy. Hence, bet sizing’s primary importance lies in the fact that it helps to
prevent capital loss on a single trade.
Question 110: "What are the parameters in the EF3M algorithm for Gaussian
mixtures?"
Answer: The EF3M algorithm returns: µ1 , µ2 , 1 , 2 , namely the means and
standard deviations of the two Gaussian distributions and the probability p1 that
a random sample is drawn from the first distribution.

• Faizan Ahmed,
• Hamza Akbar
• Muhammad Yasir Mukhtar.
Question 111: "What is Mean-Vairance Optimization?"

3.30. SAMPLING (WEIGHTED SAMPLING, ETC.)

55

Answer: Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO), also known as Markowitz Portfolio Theory, is a widely used framework for constructing an optimal investment
portfolio. MVO begins by estimating the expected returns of different assets in
the portfolio. These expected returns serve as a measure of the potential gain or
loss from holding each asset. The concept of risk in MVO is represented by the
variance or standard deviation of the portfolio’s returns. The idea is to consider
not only the expected return of a portfolio but also the volatility or variability of
those returns.
Question 112: "What is the role of the covariance matrix in Mean-Variance
Optimization?"
Answer: MVO takes into account the relationships between different assets
by considering their covariance or correlation. Positive correlations indicate that
assets tend to move in the same direction, while negative correlations suggest they
move in opposite directions. Diversification benefits arise from combining assets
with lower or negatively correlated returns.
3.29. Sampling (Random Sampling, Sequential Sampling & Cluster Sampling)
• Anubhav Singh,

Question 114: "How does Weighted Sampling work?"
Answer: Weighted sampling assigns different weights to data points, influencing their likelihood of being included in a sample. This technique is valuable in
finance datasets, allowing emphasis on specific characteristics like transaction volumes or critical time points, addressing imbalances, and enhancing model training for more meaningful insights. By giving varying importance, sample weights
contribute to more accurate and representative results in financial analysis and
modeling.
Question 115: "How does Weighted Sampling address imbalances in transactions?"

56

3. EXAM PREPARATION - POSSIBLE QUESTIONS BASED ON THE STUDENTS CONTRIBUTIONS

Answer: Weighted Sampling balances imbalances, allowing the model to learn
effectively across different transaction volumes.
Question 116: "How does Weighted Sampling address critical time points?"
Answer: Weighted Sampling can explore instances with unique market conditions, e.g., significant price movements. Weighted sampling assigns higher weights
to instances from these critical time points.

• Bhumi R. Patel (23034011)
• Mit Desai (23016300)
Question 117: "Why do we need Fractional Differentiation?"
Answer: Financial time series data tends to be non-stationary (mean and variance do nor remain constant over time) and traditional differencing methods might
remove important information. Fractional Differentiation helps balance the need
for stationarity while retaining memory of past observations, improving the accuracy of predictive models in finance.

3.37. INTEGRATION OF CLUSTERING ,CO-DEPENDENCE AND WEIGHTED SAMPLING

57

Answer:
• Input Gate: Selects and processes incoming financial data.
• Forget Gate: Decides what historical financial information is no longer
relevant.
• Output Gate: Determines the information to be used for financial predictions.
Question 121: "Which states are responsible for the hidden and the cell state?"
Answer:
• Hidden state (Ht ): is our ’short-term financial memory,’ focusing on the
immediate market conditions.
• Cell state (Ct ): is our ’long-term financial memory,’ retaining information
for ongoing and future financial predictions.

• Bisma Arshad (23075609)
Question 122: "What is the Triangular Moving Average (TMA)?"
Answer: The TMA is a type of moving average calculated by averaging the
prices of an asset over a period of time, giving greater weight to the most recent
data points. The TMA is unique in that it gives more weight to the middle of the
time period used, and less weight to the beginning and end of the period.

• Shreyas Chakravarthy (23074733)
• Shuqi Zhang (23035620)
Question 123: "Why does one study the Risk of Structural Breaks in pairs trading?"
Answer: Rapid market changes, known as structural breaks, can disrupt the
established relationships between paired stocks, leading to significant losses in
intraday trading.
3.41. Structural Breaks
• Hari Krishnan
• Dilli Ravi (23240283)
• Shirley Nikkitha (23148087)

• Aravind Ryali (23072348)
• Dhaleema Davis (23236396)
Question 124: "How does Density-Based Spatial Clustering work?"
Answer: Given a set of points in some space, it groups together points that
are closely packed together (points with many nearby neighbours), marking as
outliers points that lie alone in low-density regions (whose nearest neighbours are
too far away).
Question 125: "How do isolation forest work?"

3.44. CROSS-SECTIONAL ASSET PRICING

59

Answer: The step-by-step approach of isolation forest :
• Initialize the algorithm by setting the number of isolation trees to be
grown, the maximum depth of each tree, subsampling size.
• For each isolation tree, randomly select a subset of the data and grow
the tree by repeating partitioning the data. This will continue until a leaf
node or the maximum depth is reached. The splitting value of each tree
will be a random value between maximum and minimum value of that
feature.
• Outliers are identified as points with a shorter average path length than
normal points
3.43. Entropy Feature

• Kenil Savani (23080185)
• Janvi Ladola (23088219)
• Hardikkumar Vaghela (23076156)
Question 126: "What is the role of the Lemple-Ziv algorithm?"
Answer: LZ algorithm efficiently decomposes a message into non-redundant
substrings. If we increase the available history, we can expect that messages with
high entropy will produce relatively shorter non-redundant substrings.
3.44. Cross-Sectional Asset Pricing
• Brij Vachhani (23219225),
• Chetan Rakhasiya (22981334),
• Khaled Saifullah (22783639),
• Muhammad Ismail (23035796),
• Sandip Kumar Basak (23041782).
Question 127: "How does the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) work?"
Answer: CAPM is a model to determine price of any individual stock based
on the market risk. CAPM focuses on market risk. After calculating the expected
return, we shall take the decision if the investment is appropriate or not. Since,
this model is only focused on one factor, i.e., market risk, it is also called as singlefactor asset pricing model.
Question 128: "How does the Fama-French Three Factor Model work?"
Answer: Fama-French Three Factor Model : It is an extension of the Capital Asset Pricing Model itself. While the CAPM only focuses on the systematic
risk/market risk, FF Three Factor Model focuses on another two factors. These
factors are book-to-market ratio as well as market capitalisation (size of a firm)
factor.
Question 129: "How does the Fama-French Five Factor Model work?"

60

3. EXAM PREPARATION - POSSIBLE QUESTIONS BASED ON THE STUDENTS CONTRIBUTIONS

Answer: Fama-French Five Factor Model: In 2015, profitability and investment were added to the earlier highly-successful FF Three Factor model. This
model was later considered a failure due to overfitting concerns.
Question 130: "How do Stochastic Discount Factors work?"
Answer: The price of an asset at time t is the expected discounted value of the
asset’s pay-off based on information available at time t. The Stochastic Discount
Factor method is used with multiple characteristics-based factors to determine
cross- sectional pricing patterns in a reduced-form(without explicitly specifying
the underlying economic factors that drive asset prices) pricing model.
